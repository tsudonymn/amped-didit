Anyway TL;DR; I have a desire to have Josh and or Sandra actually just be straight with us and transparent around the POs and rates. Instead of the literal nothing that we hear now.
I'm hoping that when we all gather here in a couple weeks perhaps I'll be able to feel some others out around a similar desire.
