# Agility Assessment

I liked what Jon Fazzaro put together for a team and decided to follow that format for my transition

## Agility
  - Delivery 
    - Is the team delivering working software to some subset of real users at least every two weeks and gathering feedback?
      - Yes
        - Team delivers software to prod on a more or less daily basis
  - Responsivness
    - Is feedback from users turned into concrete work items for the team on timelines shorter than one month?
      - Yes
        - Team has a regular cadence of soliciting and ingesting feedback which can and do turn into stories for the team
  - Autonomy 
    - Is the team empowered to change the requirements based on user feedback?
      - Yes
        - See above responsiveness
  - Mastery
    - Is the team empowered to change their process based on what they learn?
      - Yes
        - The team does retrospective and based on those sessions adapt and change based on their needs
  - Purpose
    - Is there a product charter that lays out the mission and strategic goals?
      - No
        - At one point the team did have and align to a stated set of goals which the team would connect each feature to
          - Now while those goals still exist it's unclear if they are still relevant and connect to the work being asked of the team

## Observations
  - I've seen team members decide to work on things other than what the team decided and aligned on
    - On one hand it's good to see iniative to do what they believe is right
      - The downside is they are subverting known valuable prioritized work.
        - If they can't convince the team of the value then at best it should probably be a power up item until they can
  - The collaboration between design and development roles on the team needs improvement
    - The team needs to find ways to break out of the designers have to "get ahead" of the team by days or weeks
    - There is definitely a balance
