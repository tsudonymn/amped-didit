My friend put it pretty blunt. This is the summary...
Sure things take time and Ford has been on the PDO journey for 3 years and working on other iniatives for at least 10 years before that.
So if what they were trying worked would we be where we are now fighting the fights we are?
Perhaps then we should start asking some tough f-ing questions about WTAF we are going to do to not repeat the last dozen plus years?
