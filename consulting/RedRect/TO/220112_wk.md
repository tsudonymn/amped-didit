## Storymapping with Shelby teams

### Prep thoughts

- Goal
  - Talk about:
    - the what and why of mobster like tools
    - users
    - how do those change based on remote?
  - let's get 3 fact and a question
  - outcome


### My brain dump

- what do we want/need
- turn time
- role?
- time til break
- that we have the code
- 
- what information do we need to pass with the baton so the user can:
  - time
  - know context of who's what role
  - 
  - time til next break?


### Smaller Group

- remote worker
  - Full time remote
- Software development
- works on a team
- has git like repo
- not super technical
- Passionate and super focused needs reminder to help with collobarating with the rest of the team
