Oh and totally out of left field any chance you are available tomorrow 11-12  to help facilitate an intro/refresh on mobbing? I am helping Jessica and it's for the loyalty team and we have way more people interested than expected. So trying to see if I can shrink the size of the mobs by increasing the number of coaches :)
