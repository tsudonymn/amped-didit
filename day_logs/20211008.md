- Get multi sensor ESP Node up
  - New ESP 32 from amazon may be defunct
    - Can't prove it's good or bad atm 
      - setting aside
  - dietpi install of home assistant is different from all the tutorials
    - I suspect it's because it's the standalone core install
  - Also the Rock64 is running really ----------
	- It also seemed to be taxed by home assistant
- DietPi would be good to upgrade to Buster or from or w/e
  - What's actuall installed on DietPi
    - of what's installed what do I care about?
      - Samba server for sure for the archive drive
      - nodered
        - Though if I get multi sensors up I'm not sure if I care
        - Can I leverage the ESP Home nodes from nodered making it additative?
      - Nextcloud
- Pitch my elder care ecosystem idea to EHEI
- Clean tank
- Bloom after work
- Install Home Assistant on Odroid C4
  - Which version?
    - May just try the lightweight OS version
    - Can move to the container version when PI cluster is up?
  - Remove any files and such from C4 as I'll reuse the drive as I only have the one of that type
  - how best to move files off
    - SCP
