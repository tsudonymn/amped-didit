# Visualization
- show the amount of time spent in support
  - Since most teams don't have an accurate accounting show a bunch of common examples
-  Show customer impact of downtime
-  I'm imagining a bunch of somewhat flashy animation of pie graphs and charts in some sort of linear flow
-  If we have data that we can help them find on their app then great otherwise we just start with an example
-  lets's find your data! -> hmm can't find it that's ok! ->
-  great you found it! Let's see what it looks like! (here we distill the data to very near the simple "let me google that for you" level )
