- do not use standard HTTP/HTTPS ports
- or are hosted on an API Manager 
### Want to Troubleshoot?
If your endpoint does not require authentication and is not hosted on an API Manager, 
then try the below:
1. Go to your health endpoint in your browser and see if you can reach it.
2. Try connecting to your endpoint within the Ford Network or while on the Ford VPN.
    \- HealthNut can only access endpoints in the Ford Network or externally through the Ford proxy.\-
