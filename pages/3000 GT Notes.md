  -----
  Still experiencing flooding type situation on occasion 
  seems to be when warm
  EGR still under strong suspiscion - could be put in exhaust when unnecessary not letting enough O2 in then not burning 
  but could be:
  Intake - doubtful as just not consistent - but could still be intermitent leak
  IAC - need to find out more about this
  Fuel Pump - though again the strong gas smell leads me to believe no
  fuel filter - not as likely but still 
  MAS - another candidate unable to access possible impact yet.
