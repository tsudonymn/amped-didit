- Mobile friendly?
- Seems like it needs one more ingredient...
- pygame?
- deckbuildingesque element?
- maybe find alien artifacts along the way
- find materials
	- ore?
	- metals?
	- parts from enemies
- free control?
- thinking its mostly watching with perhaps times where you can take control
- if not in control you should be able to pause
	- some upgrades and "cards" you can play along the way
	- others you need to be at a base
- upgrade your base?
- get air/space support
- if you aren't in control what happens around rocks and holes?
	- Can your bot miss?
		- what happens if so?
