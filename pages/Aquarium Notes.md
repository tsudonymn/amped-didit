  1/10/04
- New coral (unkown) from FD
  along with 4 mexican turbo (snicker) snails
  and a cucumber that now lives in the refugium
- Zebra leg hermit weny after one of the snails this morning
  and was after one of the conchs yesterday
  may need to relocate the 2 bigger ones to the refugium
- Broke off 2 frags from the montipora frag and they need mounting
  the main frag still has some polyp extension
  but seems to be losing the war against the algae
  I'll keep burshing it and see if I can't help turn the tide
  -----------------------------------------------
  1/6/04
- Added new salt mix with kalwasser mix added
  Not good PH swing occured but luckily wasn't bad
- Blue Star only lasted a few days 
  Something happened to it to it's leg
  Dunno if something got at him or if something else happened
  but it went downhill from there
- Coral is still doing bad
  the peice that I broke off seems to be somewhat better off
  still don't know why it's not happier
  it's in direct MH with lots of flow so maybe less light and less flow?
  -----------------------------------------------
  12/14/03
- yesterday's splurge:
  ~4lbs live rock
  1 rock w/recordia
  1 clam
  1 blue star
  2 $10 portions of macro algae
  10lbs dry base rock (US Volcanic)
  bus idea - Modular tanks
  easier to setup/teardown
  build up theory
  flexibility
  ph 8.0
  kh 7deg
  -----------------------------------------------
  12/03/03
- It's been 3 days since the last sighting of the albino mithrax crab
- One of the clown fish commited suicide. Given where he was found the it was the right rear plastic peice that was needed
  The left I cut down and put back into place
  But I'll be kicking myself for a while although I don't think it would have made a difference
- Other creatures lost since the last entry
  Xenia from the Urchin disappeared shortly after it joined the tank dunno what happened may have let go and is somewhere out of sight
  2 of the convict gobies
  1 just went MIA the other somehow got into the venturi side of the protien skimmer
  the second orange collared snail
  1 of the sally light foots which I think was done in by the other sally light foot
  and since I don't see mention of it the of the peppermint shrimp has been MIA since not long after they were added
- Creatures added along the way
  Added some more rock 
  Hunk of turtle grass into refugium
  Yellow polyps from Larry
  1 Blue Tuxedo Urchin came w/some turtle grass attached and some Xenia
  4 Bangai Cardinals
  1 Coral Beauty
  3 Convict Gobies
  2 Percula Clown Fish
  1 Algae Blenny
  2 Sally Light Foot
  2 Mithrax (1 green/1 albino)
  8 Astrea Snails
  Capanella frag from Larry
  ~3-4 Red leg hermits

  -----------------------------------------------
  after other b412/03/03
  looking to add a little more of the live sand from the last place
  Added peice of rock from the stuff I bought at Tropocorium into refugium to help with cycling
  added more water and 
  -----------------------------------------------
  Larry helped Plumb the new tank it's ready to gravity feed into the main tanks
  -----------------------------------------------
  Setup up 45g Refugium/Macro Algae Tank
  w/ sand bed 4-5in max
  Should have rinsed the sand
  spent a long while filtering/polishing w/ coffee filters and a home made spray bar
  after all the cloudy extra fine silt was gone the tank sat for a good while
  until I had more time
  -----------------------------------------------
  looking to add a little more of the live sand from the last place
  Had the 45g drilled 
  2 holes + overflow box
  -----------------------------------------------
  b412/03/03
  Disaster struck upon trying to extract the egg laiden cleaner shrimp
  As I managed to knock over the rock structure and spent the next hour
   or so trying and failing to get it anywhere near what it had been.
- So all the setup of the 10 gallon tank and such has gone out the
  window. But I'll have brine shrimp this evening. =P
  For next time:
  Get 10 gallon ready much sooner
  Extract shrimp upon egg color change or maybe put into a side hanging deal and then relocate the hatchlings?
  Start brine shrimp earlier
  Raise main tank temp 
  -----------------------------------------------
  04/13/03
- -10% water change
  -a mess but otherwise uneventful
  -need to use smaller perhaps longer tube for finer control
  over flow and what you're removing
  -----------------------------------------------

- Adventures in RO setup
- So A week or so a go I order a Typhoon III 5 stage RO/DI unit from www.airwaterice.com
  Last night I began setting it up. Which since I did not want to poke a hole in my 
  plumbing, as I'm not sure where the final resting spot of the RO unit will be, I decided
  to put together a small fitting to tap into. So I ventured off to Home Depot to get 
  supplies for this as well as my surge tank project I'm trying to get together. Well the
  guys at HD were actually fairly helpful but their stock wasn't. They were lacking in
  many basic plumging fittings that would have made life easier. What I ended up with was:
  -3/4" coupling to 1/2" slip fit (try describing that to the young lady at the cash register)
  -3" piece of 1/2" PVC 
  -1/2" cap
