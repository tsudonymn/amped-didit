- Your customer service rep went above and beyond to help me close out all outstanding issues and then the delivery is rescheduled after I had already gone to great lengths to prepare and rearr5ange my work schedule. Now I have to wait yet another week after already having to reschedule from Sat to Wed. Is this really the customer experience you want? Because I am completely underwhelmed after being so happy at the lengths your agent went to to have it all undermined was not only frustrating for me I'd guess the agent was unhappy as well.
