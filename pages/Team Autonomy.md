- History as I recall:
	- Started on a while back when I posed the question to the Admin Team
		- How might we let people choose their own team instead of assigning them?
			- John Handy and I talked about it and he pushed back some and had some reasons
				- I don't recall them
				- He also was onboard with increasing the self service aspect in people being able to indicate their preference without depending on them talking to the manager
		- Next was bringing this up with Amy and Elise in 3rd quarter goals meeting on Mon
		- Then an item was put in Retro titled Allocations? (discuss)
			- Sounds like Tanmay put it in
				- Need to chat with him to understand the direction he was trying to have the conversation go

- Trying to find the game company that was big on self forming teams
	- Obsdian maybe?
	- Thought it might be riot and it wasn't.
- Spotify squads and tribes
	- comes up a lot for it's tribes and it's not clear they let those self form
	- And found an article that was indicating they weren't even what people thought

		- Not recommending we copy blindly especially because
- Culture design and continual improvement
- Questions to pose:
	- Do we tell team what cards to work on?
	- Do we believe we should learn from the customers not tell them what to do
	  In college did you choose what classes you wanted to take so you could learn what you wanted to learn?
	- Some classes you had to for a particular choice and most you choose
	  Your major you choose
	- And you could choose a different major if you wanted!
- Survey design
	- linkert scale?
		- How much autonomy do you desire
- Tanmay is an ally
	- This process has been harming more than helping us
