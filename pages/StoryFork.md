			- How to handle different versions/editions/etc?
		- The various numbers in the front of books
		- Is there a better way for formats like epub?
	- How do others see what's available?
- Ideally it would be integrated with ebook so as you were reading you could see forks
- Another way would be to search by book, series, author, etc?
- Legal stuff
	- Seems safe if it's just talking about a point in a book
	- The trouble gets to be allowing people to read the edit in context
	- You kind of want it to be an overlay if it's not purely divergent vs a bunch of smaller edits
		- Does fair use cover some of that?
	- Seems like if you own a copy especially in a epub-esque format then doing the overlay is safe
- UI/UX
	- Encourage a reading vs authoring split?
	- personalized recommendations
