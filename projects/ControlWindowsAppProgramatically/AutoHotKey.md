# Auto Hot HKey

- Suggestion from Eric
- Looks pretty promising

Wasn't activating the HTML Tads window

Added activation and it doesn' think it found it and yet it seems to work?


Need to pass strings quoted

There doesn't seem to be a send and then hit enter so created a function to do that

KeyWait doesn't seem to be doing anything...
