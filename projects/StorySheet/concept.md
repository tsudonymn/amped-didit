# Spreadsheet evolved

WOuldn't it be great if you could just create a sticky and put some text or numbers and then connect it to something that does something with the text and numbers and displays the output?

SO I want to tell a story with some data...
I could try and use a spreadsheet and the two dimensional constraint is the problem.
I want to tell a story...
I want to be able to connect the same data in various ways to test hypothesis and get feedback
I want to be able to share my story and collaborate with others on it.
So elements of a spreadsheet in terms of connecting data to formulas
Some elements of a jupyter notebook in I can write and maniplute data
And jupyter is vary linear

I want to be able to connect post its on a white board and see results in more or less real time.
I can move the data post it's and formula post it's around as my story evolves
So apps like Miro and Mural do the visual board with post its and templates
And it's missing the formulas

So maybe can write a plugin to one of them?
