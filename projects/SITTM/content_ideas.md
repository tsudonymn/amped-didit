Environment

I've seen many ways to be successful in the short term on a wide breath of topics:

- tdd
- ci/cd
- OO
- BDD

All of which thrive only when tended like a garden. Your garden might take more or less time depending on environmental factors and mostly share the same dilema that if left untended or underattended will fail to thrive.
Why is this?
There is no one answer beyond context.
So let's go through some of the myriad of ways our lovely value garden can go wrong...

- Toxic team member
  - Sadly sometimes it only takes one
- lack of support from the organization
  - This can take on many forms of it's own
- What are the incentives and detractors?
  - Are you're managers promoted by feature delivery and execution?
    - How do you get software

Putting seeds down in a parking lot isn't likely to lead to successful garden
So we should probably pay attention to the context of where/who/how are starting the team off
And it's not just about not being on pavement
have to turn the soil, fertilize, worry about pollination

Has your company been sowing expensive seeds in a parking lot and wondering why they aren't growing as the birds eat them off the concrete? Come join a conversation on how and how not to foster successful software teams. We'll talk about preparing the soil, companion planting, pollination, and other patterns to help ensure your team becomes fruitful and productive only in the context of software development teams! You leave with sound strategies to help improve the yield in your own garden.

What are the keystone practices to shoot for?

- easy to assess
  - Are you delivering to prod each day?
  - How long does it take to go from zero to commiting to prod?
- tdd
- ci/cd
  - daily delivery?
