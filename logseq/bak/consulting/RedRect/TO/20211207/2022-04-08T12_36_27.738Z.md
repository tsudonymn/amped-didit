## Gather meeting

### New Artisan teams

- Shelby Doc
- FCG Doc

- Are we trying to describe goals and outcomes at the high level 
  - The LL3 Netta example
  - Or do we believe it would be helpful to drive more concrete guidelines
    - "Thou shalt..."
    - Probably a balance and how to strike the right one?

### Metrics

- Should we even continue pursuing?
- Can we get better metrics out of Sonarqube?
  - Spin up our own 
  - run on known repos
  - Check metrics
