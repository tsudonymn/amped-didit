- Invoicing
	- Ugh back to the credential dance of where do they need to be
		- And why when it sees it's not there and writes it is that not the "correct" location?
	- Trying putting the credentials.json so the result in the invoicing module folder. Which will likely then need to be updated and just want to know if that's where it's looking cause even in the debugger it just says "credentials.json"
		- That didn't working
	- trying in the /src dir
		- No dice
	- trying /
		- now it's blowing up trying to connect to harvest
		- not sure if it's related or it got past the google creds and now is having trouble with the harvest creds

	- Lots of talk about who is the product owner
