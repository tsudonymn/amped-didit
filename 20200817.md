- lots of frustration around people working on machines that the whole group can't see
- Fixed Healthnut bug that looked like we wrecked the token and didn't
  - Was actually bug from the formatting stuff we did last week
- Talked with Eric around Aaron R coming to visit and mob tomorrow
- Spoke to the whole dept during meeting on making things visible and leaning toward faster feedback
  - Kind of fell of deaf ears and it's about planting seeds
  - Got some immediate feedback from Mike R that he agreed
- All in all not a bad day
