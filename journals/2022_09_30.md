- Are we only about is the customer able to give us feedback about need/want?
	- Ex FinSimple
		- Do people want loans?
			- from Ford Credit?
		- Seems like there is space for what might we be able to provide given that desire?
		- So what happens when it's less about if and more about how?
		- Is that something we want to be part of?
		- Seems like we are about value validation and using customer feedback to achieve it
