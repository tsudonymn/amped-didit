- with Kevin and Josh
- React fundamentals
- Trying to move quickly
- expereiments based on value
- from user data
- are we on hackathon vs going with user centered data on rewrite
- the AAPI and up layer will be similar
- styling will be very different
- just to get back to the first style
- just jumped in on the side of opposite
- have to wait to get amplitude data
- kevin and josh are independant pairing data
- interested in the single user id thing did soemthing similar in credit
- joining not a great experience
- in and out of labs for hackathon
- presumption of being pretty capable
- trouble navigating remote work

- should have been doing more 1on1s for
- WOuld have liked to see more leadership trying to facilitate that
- stayed on newsie long enough to feel comfortable
	- maybe feels like would have left otherwise
- more new faces channel
- 10 1on1s at the start
- What are the norms and guidelines
- established vs new at end of DEI pres
- team processes need to change to be as effective as in person
- Example: frustration over comms on CDN w/ JH
- over the hujmkp and much better feeling like can nav the org
- frustration with feeling like not enough time to dig in vs help with onboarding etc
- doesn't feel like mentoring is seen as valuable and set as goals
- formality around and initionaltiy around coaching and mentoring
- not great around the idea of trying to teach and code and having the code suffer
- working with peers and learning from over "coaching"
