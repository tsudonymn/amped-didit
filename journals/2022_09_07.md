- Home Assistant + Node Red for physical button
	- [[Home Assistant Node Red MQTT]]
	- Added MQTT integration and need to do MQTT Broker first
		- Added user though I'm not sure that was needed as it turns out?
		- Once broker was installed HA wasn't discovering it

		- Added MQTT integration
	- How to integrate with N.R.?
		- Following:
