- Initial [[Team Autonomy]] discussion
	- Started on a while back when I posed the question to the Admin Team
		- How might we let people choose their own team instead of assigning them?
			- John Handy and I talked about it and he pushed back some and had some reasons
				- I don't recall them
				- He also was onboard with increasing the self service aspect in people being able to indicate their preference without depending on them talking to the manager
		- Next was bringing this up with Amy and Elise in 3rd quarter goals meeting on Mon
		- Then an item was put in Retro titled Allocations ()
