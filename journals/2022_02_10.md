- What type of barcode is a VIN?
  Historically, the standard Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) embedded within a barcode and attached to a car has been represented by the Code 39 symbology. The Uniform Symbology Specification Code 39 (USS Code 39) is used for vehicle identification, and while based on Code 39, it does not contain start and stop characters.
	- Automotive manufacturers are now utilizing two-dimensional barcodes to represent VINs on their automobiles. For example, General Motors (GM) now utilizes the Data Matrix barcode symbology to represent the VIN on some models. Ford uses a QR Code for marketing on their window stickers. Automotive auction houses utilize the one-dimensional Code 128 barcode type VIN representations for cars in their auction runlists.
	- Some US Federal labels and State vehicle registration documents store VINs within PDF417 barcodes since data capacity and space efficiency are two of its major advantages. There are also security features that can be used with PDF417.
