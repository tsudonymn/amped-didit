- Restaurant recommendation from Amy
	- Frame?
	- N of Detroit?

- Model E Dealer Kickoff
	- Will have to come from internal customers?
		- Don't understand that
		- They don't seem to understand customer
		- Voice of customer is not the same
	- So are we like Turbo Tax?
		- No one wants to do taxes and yet they have to and so how do we minimize the pain
	- Dan asked if they came from Dealers
		- They didn't answer directly
		- And went back to Dealers don't want to do this
		- Zafar clarified on bucket
		- Todd Rouston
			- Talked about docs that the Ford gave that turned into the buckets
	- I would have loved to feel like we started agreeing on the goal
		- It feels like we have talked about it and how might we make sure everyone is nodding about what success would look like?
		- Basically taking another step from the conversations we had at the scoping
	- Adrienne Joseph
		- Background
	- To restate and try to make it clearer I wouldn't want to end up in a debate over "rules" over have a discussion about why what we are asking for is so valuable. If I'm coming across clearly.
