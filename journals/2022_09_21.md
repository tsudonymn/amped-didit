-
- PO engagement
- Omi trying to get office hours
- keeps getting cancelled
- We take direction from the PM
- Wondering
- Transportation rotation
	- wasn't actually doing
	- research and analysis
	- Like the idea of getting into more of that
	- How to start heading that way
	- How to get some exposure to more of that?
- Feel like learning
- op to explore
- in and out of projects
- time and understanding to work on DEI things
- effect some sort of change
- some sort of mobility and transportation field
- thinking about how better to leverage the technology
- lack of carpooling
- brainstorming is tough
- missing element of the office

- Renee would do things in newsie support channel

	- even something small
	- she would put out a small blurb about a feature
