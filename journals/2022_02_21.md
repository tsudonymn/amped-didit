	- Feels like
		- IF dealers will truly take whatever currently because people want trucks right now then you don't need RR cause just build w/e you can
		- If you think that sometime this year that will change and you are ready to close the gap with the dealers then maybe there's value
		- Overall this still doesn't feel valuable as it appears as though we are enabling the dysfuntional relationship of Ford to Dealers
			- Could we leverage this to trying and shift that to how might we encourage better communication and collaboration with the dealers around ordering
		- What is the current state?
		- What would the ideal state look like?
