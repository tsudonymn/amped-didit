- Another data point in the mob.sh and handovers driving long mob times
	- Henry
	- Thaddeus
	- Justin
	- We went to 20 mins cause at 5 minutes we can't get enough done before we have to handover
	- So on one hand it's not about the time per sea
	- It's about not being able to focus down to small enough chunks
	- Context
		- Lots of discussion and trying to figure out what they are trying to do
		- So not greatest example of we're mainly coding and have a good direction
		- is this part and parcel to this type of situation around wanting longer turns?
