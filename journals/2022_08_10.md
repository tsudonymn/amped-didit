- Instead of best practices how about we start with more here's what worked for us? We have a tendency to label anything that works as a best practice which is at best possibly true for a small data set as low as n=1 and at worst completely misleading see n=1. Is that valuable or is it better to provide the data transparently? We did this and it worked here are the relevant details we can provide?
