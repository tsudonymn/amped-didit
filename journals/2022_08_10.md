- Instead of best practices how about we start with more here's what worked for us? We have a tendency to label anything that works as a best practice which is at best possibly true for a small data set as low as n=1 and at worst completely misleading see n=1. Is that valuable or is it better to provide the data transparently? We did this and it worked here are the relevant details we can provide?

- My current concern is with Matt leaving we are starting to look a little thin on more senior folk. So while there is no immediate need finding senior people that already have worked the way we work has always been challenging. Full disclosure Dorman and I worked with this person they have a few years of experience working in the way we want in the context of Ford.
