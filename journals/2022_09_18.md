- Aaron and leadership visit
	- Dorman asking about how many people volunteered
	- Looking for volunteers willing to pair/mob with Aaron and a group of leaders on Oct 13th. You will also be able to help plan what we want to show them. We are currently planning on hosting them at the robotics labs for a half day. These are leaders from around the globe that are flying in for a series and of meetings and are taking some time to come see how we work. A great opportunity to influence high level leaders from around the organization! All roles encouraged. Message myself or Elise if you are interested.

	- Lots of feedback so going to hold off on posting for a bit
	- Volk says the degree req shouldn't be a problem
