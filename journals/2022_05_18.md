- TeamViewer to Code with Me meeting
	- Voiced a bunch of concerns and they weren't really addressed
	- And they aren't forcing everyone... yet
- Talked with Handy and Elise around this
- Elise asked Labs
	- Labs seems to use Pop when they need that type of tool which is good
		- Couldn't recall the problems we had with Pop
