# Group vision

- Is Mike S a good person to lean on for them
- Sylvia to put forth some vision
- Talk about Huff and Sumanth
  - Eric had a great uptick and has been quiet
  - Sumanth on a good trend
- Too many irons in the fire?
  - Well we have a bunch of new people and new tools and skills so maybe we can figure a way to narrow down either end of the equation. Less different things which may narrow the tooling or narrow the tools and then we can apply them to more things.

- How can I help Sylvia with her new role?
- Would she be able to join in mobs?
